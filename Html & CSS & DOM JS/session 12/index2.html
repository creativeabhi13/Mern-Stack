Suryakumar Yadav’s gritty half century and his partnership with Shivam Dube guided India to a hard-fought 
7-wicket win against the USA as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma flopped again, scoring 0 and 3 respectivelyUSA 
got penalized 5 runs due to slow over rate which made things a little easier for India who waltzed to the Super 8s wit
 this win.

Meanwhile, Kohli departed for a golden duck as Saurabh Netravalkar struck early with India going one down in just
the first over. Netravalkar would strike again in his second over, this time sending back skipper Rohit as India 
were left reeling at 10/2. Rishabh Pant would compound India’s worries when he also got cleaned up by Ali Khan.
